    "content": "Autonomous Robot for Precision Wall PaintingI led the design, programming, and integration of an autonomous robot designed to paint a clean, uniform line above wall trim—one of the most tedious tasks in residential wall painting. This project was developed as part of a year-long engineering design course and required close collaboration across mechanical, electrical, and software subteams.Project MotivationAmateur painters consistently cited “cutting” (painting the narrow strip above trim) as the most difficult and time-consuming part of the painting process. We set out to automate this task using a three-part robotic system that drives along a wall, detects trim height, and paints a precise 1.5-inch line.My Contributions  System Design &amp; Integration: I oversaw the integration of the robot’s three core systems—driving, sensing, and painting—and managed overall project direction.  CAD Modeling: I was responsible for the final 3D models, including the paint applicator assembly, actuator mounts, custom sensor brackets, and flange-couple connectors.  Electrical Design: I selected and wired all microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and motor drivers. I also developed a robust power distribution system and created a complete system schematic.  Embedded Programming: I programmed both the Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi Pico, implementing I²C communication and logic for real-time wall alignment and painting control.  Testing &amp; Troubleshooting: I validated each subsystem independently and led final integration testing, including the feedback-based wall detection and actuator control loop.Key Features  Autonomous Wall Detection: Uses a multi-zone ToF sensor and contact limit switches to identify wall distance, alignment, and trim height.  Precision Painting: Paint is delivered from a squeezable silicone reservoir through a cloth-covered sponge to create clean, repeatable lines.  Modular Hardware: All components mount to a robust aluminum drive base with adjustable linear actuators for vertical positioning.Outcomes  Successfully painted clean, even lines above varying trim heights with minimal prep.  Presented the working prototype at Design and Innovation Day.  Demonstrated commercial feasibility in a rental-based business model."
